Hello my name is Ryan and I am currently working on building a basic website about recipes
In doing so I hope to illustrate my learned skills so far with creating the webpage.
The skills I hope to demonstrate include creating the website, add varied text, images, lists and possible links to other pages for reference. 
Among those being able to write the code and succesfully stage and commit the code itself to github and make a quality log of the code I implemented and possibly changed.
In addition to staging and commiting the code I hope to show my ability to write clear and concise commit messages wiht subject and body propely utilized.
