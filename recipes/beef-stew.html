        <h2>Hearty beef stew with carrots and potatoes</h2>
        <p>This recipes will instruct you on how to creat a hearty beef stew your whole family will enjoy. It has taken me several tries to get to where this recipe is now and I am quite happy with where it's at now. This stew consists of nice pieces of chuck roast beef, diced onions, diced garlic, sliced carrots and diced russet potatoes but you are more than welcome to add other ingredients you wish but for the sake of this recipes these are what I have been using. In this recipe I use a slow cooker to make sure the chuck roast cut get to cook low and slow for long enough the the meat just melts in you mouth once finished.</p>
