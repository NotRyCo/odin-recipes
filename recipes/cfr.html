                <h2>Delicious chicken fried rice with carrots and peas</h2>
                    <p>Chicken fried rice is super easy to make with a little bit of prep time including the day before. Chicken fried rice is best made with day old leftover rice but I've definitely made the mistake of not making it the day before and just making it right before the chicken and it still comes out great! This truly is a one pan meal for us and it always comes out amazing and feeds the whole family with zero leftovers.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons butter or unsalted margerine</li>
                        <li>1 1/2-2 pounds chicken breast, diced into 1/2 cubes</li>
                        <li>1/2 large white onion, diced</li>
                        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and diced</li>
                        <li>1 cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
                        <li>3 eggs</li>
                        <li>3 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
                        <li>3 cups 1 day old leftover rice of your choice, I prefer Jasmin.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li>Add chicken and cook until golden brown stirring every few minutes. About 10-15 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Remove chicken and set aside. Add in remaining olive oil and diced onions and cook until translucent. Around 5-7 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant. About 1-2 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add in frozen peas and carrots and cook until warmed through. Around 5 minutes</li>
                        <li>Move veggie mix to one side of the pan and add 1 tablespoon of butter or margerine on empty side. Crack eggs in butter, season, scramble and cook through. Around 4-5 minutes</li>
                        <li>Combine eggs with veggie mixture. Add in cooked chicken and the leftover rice. Combine fully.</li>
                        <li>Add 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and let food mixture fry for 1-2 minutes before stirring. Repeat process for about 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add sesame oil, mix and serve immediately.</li>

                    </ol>
